# Introduction to Ansible
Hello there, I'm following tutorial from acloud.guru that demonstrate the basic features on Ansible. In this tutorial, I learned how to setup 2 tiers of PHP web server & a load balancer (using Apache2) on Debian distro.

## What I have learned:
- Set up Ansible config
- Set up Ansible Inventory
- Run adhoc ansible commands/module
- Write ansible playbook
- Write ansible template file (for config file generation)

## Personal Note
You can see the load balancer management UI at `http://<load balancer ip>/balancer-manager`
